  <h1>BiasFreeEnrich, a new tool to perform an adjusted enrichment analysis of proteomic data without sample bias</h1>
  <p>This repository stores all of the data (raw, re-analysed and processed) that was used within the paper.</p>
  <p>The contents of the data folders alongside the RMD file titled "BiasFreeEnrich Related Analysis R" should be downloaded and stored within the same folder location.</p>
  <p>When the chunks are run subsequently the analytical output will be identical to those present within the published paper.</p>
